\section{Abstract} 
Polarization is an intrinsic property of transverse wave which limits the geometrical orientation of vibration. In case of transverse wave light, when an unpolarized light beam is passed through a birefrigent material certain vibrations are favoured and more readily passable than the vibration in different directions. Thereby light is polarized and the intensity is reduced. In this experient we have analysed different types of polarized light such as linearly polarized light, elliptical polarized beams on passing an unpolarized beam through different materials with birefringent properties of certain crystals (quartz, calcite etc) We have also proven that the intensity of polarized light at different direction of polarization follows Malu's law.
