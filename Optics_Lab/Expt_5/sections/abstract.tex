\section{Abstract} 
	The Michelson interferometer is used to measure things like the refraction index and wavelength of light. In this experiment, the wavelength of light beams produced by a He-Ne laser source and a Na lamp was measured using a Michelson interferometer. The interference pattern has been investigated for two sources, and the various fringe possibilities have been noted as a variable for the separation of two mirrors. The experiment's concentric circular fringes of equal inclination are examined to determine the light beams' wavelength.
