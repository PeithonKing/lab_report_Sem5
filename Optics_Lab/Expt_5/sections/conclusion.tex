	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Error in Observations:} We asumed the value of N to be absolute while calculating the error. This is because, uncertainty in calculating N can be solely due to random error. We cannot be sure about how much the value of $\Delta N$ can be. So we are reporting our value asuming there is no error in N.
		\item \textbf{Error in Equipments:} The fine adjustment knob (for m) has a very large backlash. Although we took the readings by rotating the knob only in one direction (that's why we didn't include it in the error analysis), I noted the value for fun: $\Delta n = \pm 47$.
