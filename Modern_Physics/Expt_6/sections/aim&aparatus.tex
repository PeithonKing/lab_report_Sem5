\section{Abstract}
	For the historical validation of Bohr's theory based on Planck's quantum theory, the Frank Hertz Experiment was essential. The quantization of energy states for a neon atom excited in a frank Hertz tube will be confirmed in this experiment. The graph between the collector current and accelerating voltage of the electrons from thermionic emission used to excite the Neon atoms shows the corresponding excitation energy for the most likely excitation state (10 3-p states). Maxima and minima in the curve's shape provide proof that discrete energy states corresponding to discrete excitation energy exist (accelerating voltage).
