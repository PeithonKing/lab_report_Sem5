\section{Conclusions}
	Compared to the literature value (g=2), the relative error in the value of g is 0.5\%.

	\subsection{Sources of Error}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Low precision due to large least count value of the oscilloscope. It can easily be reduced to 0.1cm by putting more graduations on both the x and y scales.
			\item Oscilloscope line is thick; leads to ambiguity while taking readings.
			\item Flowing of large currents through the helmholtz coil may heat it up, changing the resistance and hence the the value of the magnetic field.
			\item Incomplete merger of the peaks on y-scale due to many reasons such as 50Hz pick-ups, ripples in the power supply, noise, etc. However since measurement is made in the X scale only, its effect is minimal
		\end{itemize}
