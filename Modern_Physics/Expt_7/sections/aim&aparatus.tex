\section{Abstract}
When the molecules of a solid are paramagnetic and have unpaired electrons then splitting can be induced between spin states by applying a magnetic field and then the transition of electrons between layers by supplying electromagnetic energy (usually in the microwave range of frequencies). The resulting absorption spectra are described as electron spin resonance (ESR).
