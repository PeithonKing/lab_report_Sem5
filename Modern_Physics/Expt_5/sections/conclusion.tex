\section{Results \& Conclusions}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item We have therefore studied the operation of the lock-in amplifer and its phase sensitive detection.
		\item Several pieces of equipment, including loose pins and a multimeter, were the main cause of the experiment's errors. We must take care to ensure that the connections are secure.
		\item The multimeter was oscillating a lot. So, the average value of the oscillating reading on the multimeter was taken.
		\item We can observe from the experiment for mutual inductance that as the primary coil's turns are increased, both the resistance and the mutual inductance rise. Similar to this, mutual inductance would rise as the secondary coil's number of turns increased while decreasing as the distance between the coils increased.
