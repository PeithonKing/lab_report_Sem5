\section{Abstract}
	We will investigate the operation of a lock-in amplifier in this experiment, specifically how it amplifies signals most effectively when their voltages are in phase with other reference signals. This narrowing of the bandwidth also lessens the noise's amplification, especially thermal noise. This phase sensitive detection principle will be used in the experiment to measure the resistance of an external resistor and determine the mutual inductance of a transformer.
