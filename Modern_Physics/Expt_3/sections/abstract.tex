\section{Abstract}

	An excited hydrogen electron emits energy when it returns to lower energy states. This energy is released in the form of light waves. From the wavelength of the light emitted, we can calculate the energy difference between it's energy levels.

	\subsection{Objective}

		\begin{enumerate}
			\item To meaasure the wavelengths of visible spectral lines in Balmer series of atomic hydrogen.
			\item To determine the value of Rydberg's constant from the wavelengths
		\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Apparatus}

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Spectrometer
			\item Diffraction grating
			\item Hg Lamp
			\item Hydrogen Lamp
			\item $60^{\circ}$ Prism
		\end{itemize}
