\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
\item The value of the Rydberg constant came out to be pretty close to the literature value of $1.097\times 10^{7}\;m^{-1}$ (error = 6\%). Value from from ~\cite{manual}.
\item The distinct lines in the spectrum were very close to each other. This was inside the backlash error of the spectrometer. This resulted in some odd values in the data (excluded in the report).
