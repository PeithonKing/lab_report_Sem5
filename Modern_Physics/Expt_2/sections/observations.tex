\section{Observations and Calculations}

	With the magnetic field turned on,three lines can be seen simultaneously in the normal Zeeman effect in transverse direction.

	There are three groups of three lines in anomalous Zeeman effect. when the analyser is inserted into the typical Zeeman effect, the $\sigma$-lines maybe seen, and when it is turned horizonaltally only $\pi$-lines are visible.

	To calculate the Bohr Magneton, the working formula is:

	\begin{equation}
		\Delta K = \frac{B\mu_B}{hc}
		\label{eq:Delta_K}
	\end{equation}

	We linearly fit the graph of $\Delta K$ vs the B and the slope there gives us the value of Bohr Magneton ($\mu B$):

	\begin{equation}
		\mu_B = hc\frac{\Delta K}{B} = hc \times (slope\;of\;\Delta K\;vs\;B\;graph)
		\label{eq:m}
	\end{equation}

	Using the Formula $\Delta_{\sigma}^{i(i-1)} = \sigma_i^2 - \sigma_{i-1}^2$ we get \hyperref[tab:Delta]{Table 2}.

	Using the Formula $\delta^i = \sigma+_i^2 - \sigma-_i^2$ we get \hyperref[tab:Delta]{Table 3}.

	Using the Formula $\delta^i = \sigma+_i^2 - \sigma-_i^2$ we get \hyperref[tab:Delta]{Table 3}.

	% From the \hyperref[fig:graph]{Graph} we get the value of\\

	$$m = 20.115\;\pm\;4.214\;and$$ 
	$$c = 15.877\;\pm\;6.049$$
	

	$\mu_B = hc\frac{\Delta K}{B} = hc \times 20.115 = 3.998 \times 10^{-24} Am^2$

	The above tables have all the data that was collected during the experiment, the verified data sheet is attached at the end of the document. The pictures of the lines observed is attached in the next section after references.

\subsection{Error Calculation}

    $$\Delta \mu_B = \mu_B \frac{\Delta slope}{slope} = \mu_B \times \frac{4.214}{20.115}$$

    $$\Delta \mu_B = 8.3 \times 10^{-25} Am^2$$
